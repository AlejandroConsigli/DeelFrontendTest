# Deel Frontend Test

This project was created as a frontend challenge for Deel Inc.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm install`

Download and install all dependencies specified in the package.json file.

This is important if we want to run this project.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
